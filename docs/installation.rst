From sources
------------

**NOTE** that in this early version (v0.0.1), the install process and REQUIREMENTS have not been completely ironed out.  

We recommend seting up a virtual envrionment before installing db2. This can be done with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ virtualenv db2_env

Then download the sources for db2 from the `Github repo`_.

You can clone the public repository using:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/WindfallLabs/db2

and install it in the virtual environment with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd db2
    $ source ../db2_env/Scripts/activate
    $ python setup.py install

Now check the next page for how to get started using db2!
